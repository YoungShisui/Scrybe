Only dragons and monsters knew the secrets of the arcane. The only way for people to use magics was to have the power innately(sorcerers), make a pact with a greater power(warlocks), or pull power directly from the gods themselves(clerics) it wasn't until the Divines fought the Titans that wizards came about after dragons - creations of Vitiate - shared their knowledge with mortals with his blessing. Vitiates worshippers primarily consist of wizards, scholars, and clerics. While Vitiate advocates for protecting knowledge, he cares little about distribution of said knowledge. </p>
