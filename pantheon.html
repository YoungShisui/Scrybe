            <h2 class="pantheon">Order</h2>
            <p class="pantheon">Luceries, is the Divine of Order and chief deity of the pantheon. In the distant past he has led the divines and gods into battle against their adversaries.

            <p class="pantheon">Amathera above all over gods has the most followers. She is also considered the Divine of fertility, many clerics making icons and totems to increase, or decrease the odds of procreating. Compassion, selflessness, and a sense of community are core tenets to be spread from sea to sea uniting all Amatheras </p>

            <h2 class="pantheon">Magic</h2>
            <p class="pantheon">Vitiate is the Divine of Magic. In the days before the Age of Collapse, many who worshipped the Divine had animosity for the Vitiate. Only dragons and monsters knew the secrets of the arcane. The only way for people to use magics was to have the power innately(sorcerers), make a pact with a greater power(warlocks), or pull power directly from the gods themselves(clerics) it wasn't until the Divines fought the Titans that wizards came about after dragons - creations of Vitiate - shared their knowledge with mortals with his blessing. Vitiates worshippers primarily consist of wizards, scholars, and clerics. While Vitiate advocates for protecting knowledge, he cares little about distribution of said knowledge. </p>

Because of this duality his influence is vast as many find different reasons to worship him.</p>

The Al' Setseri worship Nuara as thier cheif diety, and follow a unque code called *The Way of the Ring* with Nuara at the core of the teachings. The greater moon is said to be the Divine herself and that crossing over during the night allows for easier passage into the afterife.

            <h2 class="pantheon">Chaos</h2>
            <p class="pantheon">Anelag is the Divine of Choas and is often depicted as the foil to Luceries. Despite being one of the Divine, Anelag is misunderstood. Many fear him as a force of destruction, but without chaos and change, people would stagnate and fail to progress. However, his power and force for change should not be underestimated, as his resolve is equally likely to mold you into a stronger being as it is to crush you under his indomitable will.</p>
