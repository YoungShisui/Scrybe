<h2 class="rules">Shadows over Eridon - SoE</h2>
    
    <h3 class="rules">Campaign Intro</h3>
    <p class="campaign">
        Our adventure takes place in the region of Eridon, a land of sword and sorcery. Eridon is a region tied together its by history and culture. Various monarchs’ have ruled and waged war over control of the Eridon for hundreds of years. In ages past, the monarchs of Eridon made dark dealings with the powerful witches who inhabited the shadowy forests that populate the region. These kings and queens would come to be known as Witch Kings and brought down untold disasters that kept the vast kingdoms of Eridon fractured and stooped in war. As the centuries passed many of these witches were purged by brave knights and the vengeful masses who lost their homes and families to the fell pacts the Witch Kings forged with the witches. Today, Eridon is known as a place of ancient magic, abundant with opportunity to make a name for oneself. An old adage in the area, “find a hill, become a king” reigns true to this day. From all across Tear, adventurers come to Eridon seeking everlasting glory and riches, pledging their services to the barons and monarchs that rule over its lands. 

	Eridon sits between many provinces whose influences flow into the land from the border towns and cities. To the South East, the mercantile guilds hailing from the golden hills of Kainlen bring innovation and wealth. To the West lies the Plains of Basan and the Vastlands, home to the horse lords and the roaming tribes of plains-folk that harry caravans and ill-fortified towns alike. To the South lies the Al’ Setseri desert and the great houses of its hardy people who revere the moon goddess of death above all else. To the West, the ever meddlesome Vissilian Empire encroach on the outskirts of Eridon; their ambitions of returning their Empire to its former glory never waning.  And lastly, to the East across the Pacbalt channel, the dark elves and their strange fey-ways have a long and storied history with the Eridonians. The half-elves created from the union of these people are an oddity; they are born fertile, unlike the half-elves spawned from the ash elves of Orovon or even half-breeds of other humans and dark elves. Whispers tell of ancient dealings with the Eridonian witches as cause for this, though no verifiable evidence has been brought forth.

        Five years have passed since the death of beloved King Laurence and Queen Martha Hayle of Eberard. The monarchs fell ill to a plague that ravaged the lands of Eridon killing tens of thousands. Many nobles and those with the means fled the lands, leaving the peasantry to die of illness or starve. However, the King and Queen stayed with their people selling their possessions and exchanging their wealth to pay for food and medicine to relieve their subjects, forever earning their peoples love and admiration. A knight in the service of the sickly King and Queen named Artur Saxon discovered a witch deep in the Freeoak Forest who unleashed the plague. Artur put his sword Twilight through her throat. As the Kings dying wish; his heir having perished in the plague, he named Artur as his successor to the Dawn Throne. The now King Artur Saxon established the Knights of the Dawn Realm, an order of knights sworn to protect the kingdom and ward off evil. Together with his knightly order, King Saxon rebuilt the ravaged kingdom and erected statues of the late King and Queen so that all may remember their sacrifice. 

        While conditions have improved for the people since King Saxon took the throne, the kingdom has had its fair share of strife. For one; with the plague having subsided, the Vissilians in the West have returned to their machinations of expansion, methodically expanding their influence with brides and brute force. Since many of the knights and nobles fled Eridon as the plague broke out, the warriors keeping monsters in check were suddenly absent. This emboldened the monsters to stray from their lairs further endangering the populous. Additionally, one of King Saxon’s knights, Sir Norman Brunos was seemingly driven mad after experiencing repeated visions of an entity known as The Lord of Mourning. Following these visions, Brunos defected from the Knights of the Dawn Realm and gained a militant following from his heralding of the coming of a new god. Brunos’ sermons created enough religious fervor to arrest a baroness, execute her and establish a stronghold with his followers, the Children of Mourning. 

        As the denizens of Eridon struggle to keep their kingdoms afloat, the realm needs great heroes now more than ever to decide their fate and ward against the shadows that looms over Eridon…
