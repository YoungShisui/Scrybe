            <summary class="intro"><b>Session 00, Campaign Intro</b></summary>
            <p class="intro">Our adventure takes place in the region of Eridon, a land of sword and sorcery. Eridon is a region tied together its by history and culture. Various monarchs’ have ruled and waged war over control of the Eridon for hundreds of years. In ages past, the monarchs of Eridon made dark dealings with the powerful witches who inhabited the shadowy forests that populate the region. These kings and queens would come to be known as Witch Kings and brought down untold disasters that kept the vast kingdoms of Eridon fractured and stooped in war. As the centuries passed many of these witches were purged by brave knights and the vengeful masses who lost their homes and families to the fell pacts the Witch Kings forged with the witches. Today, Eridon is known as a place of ancient magic, abundant with opportunity to make a name for oneself. An old adage in the area, “find a hill, become a king” reigns true to this day. From all across Tear, adventurers come to Eridon seeking everlasting glory and riches, pledging their services to the barons and monarchs that rule over its lands.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">Eridon sits between many provinces whose influences flow into the land from the border towns and cities. To the South East, the mercantile guilds hailing from the golden hills of Kainlen bring innovation and wealth. To the West lies the Plains of Basan and the Vastlands, home to the horse lords and the roaming tribes of plains-folk that harry caravans and ill-fortified towns alike. To the South lies the Al’ Setseri desert and the great houses of its hardy people who revere the moon goddess of death above all else. To the West, the ever meddlesome Vissilian Empire encroach on the outskirts of Eridon; their ambitions of returning their Empire to its former glory never waning.  And lastly, to the East across the Pacbalt channel, the dark elves and their strange fey-ways have a long and storied history with the Eridonians. The half-elves created from the union of these people are an oddity; they are born fertile, unlike the half-elves spawned from the ash elves of Orovon or even half-breeds of other humans and dark elves. Whispers tell of ancient dealings with the Eridonian witches as cause for this, though no verifiable evidence has been brought forth.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">Five years have passed since the death of beloved King Laurence and Queen Martha Hayle of Eberard. The monarchs fell ill to a plague that ravaged the lands of Eridon killing tens of thousands. Many nobles and those with the means fled the lands, leaving the peasantry to die of illness or starve. However, the King and Queen stayed with their people selling their possessions and exchanging their wealth to pay for food and medicine to relieve their subjects, forever earning their peoples love and admiration. A knight in the service of the sickly King and Queen named Artur Saxon discovered a witch deep in the Freeoak Forest who unleashed the plague. Artur put his sword Twilight through her throat. As the Kings dying wish; his heir having perished in the plague, he named Artur as his successor to the Dawn Throne. The now King Artur Saxon established the Knights of the Dawn Realm, an order of knights sworn to protect the kingdom and ward off evil. Together with his knightly order, King Saxon rebuilt the ravaged kingdom and erected statues of the late King and Queen so that all may remember their sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">While conditions have improved for the people since King Saxon took the throne, the kingdom has had its fair share of strife. For one; with the plague having subsided, the Vissilians in the West have returned to their machinations of expansion, methodically expanding their influence with brides and brute force. Since many of the knights and nobles fled Eridon as the plague broke out, the warriors keeping monsters in check were suddenly absent. This emboldened the monsters to stray from their lairs further endangering the populous. Additionally, one of King Saxon’s knights, Sir Norman Brunos was seemingly driven mad after experiencing repeated visions of an entity known as The Lord of Mourning. Following these visions, Brunos defected from the Knights of the Dawn Realm and gained a militant following from his heralding of the coming of a new god. Brunos’ sermons created enough religious fervor to arrest a baroness, execute her and establish a stronghold with his followers, the Children of Mourning.
            </p>
            <p class="intro">As the denizens of Eridon struggle to keep their kingdoms afloat, the realm needs great heroes now more than ever to decide their fate and ward against the shadows that looms over Eridon…

                <input class="intro" type="button" value="Dungeon Master" id="bDM01" onclick='changeText01("<b>When last we left our heroes…</b> The adventure begun one chilly morning outside the Southern guard outpost of Eberard. First to arrive was the half-elf fighter Kaelin, then the Al’ Setseri rogue Shamshir. Third to arrive was the Eridonian Siegward, a cleric of Austere and member of the Order of the Sacred Flame. Lastly to arrive was Beans, a young human rogue. As the group was waiting to hear from the herald from Greyll, a dwarf, a woman in robes, and a woman with a battleaxe departed the guard outpost. The woman in robes told the party to go home and that they would be the ones completing the quest. The heroes then went inside to hear the heralds tale. The barons son John Rivers had been missing after chasing after a pack of bhrulk with his two retainers. Determined to collect the 1500 reward for returning the son to the baron the party heads forth after a warning from the herald about undead attacks on the town. The party heads Southeast to Greyll when they encounter the dwarf and two women from before waiting to ambush the party. A fight ensues and the heroes easily defeat their attackers. After two more days of travel the party arrives to the gates of Greyll where they are set up by undead. Beans and Kaelin fall unconscious as the party earns a narrow victory. The party rest and recover at the drunken mug. The next morning the party finds Kel Thom Lagroth outside the baron keep who directs the party towards where John Rivers was seen last. The party heads out and finds a creek. In the distance; along the creek, the party spots a brown hump which is revealed to be a horse when the party nears. The party investigates and follows the horses tracks after discovering a gaping wound on its side. The tracks lead them to a site of a battle, two humans lay dead, alongside a party of bones and bhrulk.");'/>
                <input class="intro" type="button" value="Shamshir" id="bSham01" onclick='changeText01("The week was chaos, blood, and a test of observation. Kaelen’s skill and humor kept the group’s morale high, though Beans’ antics almost got him killed more than once. Seigward’s devotion to Austere and command over radiant power is impressive, though his timing for humor could silence a tavern. As for me, I missed far too many strikes—but I noted everything, from skeletal attacks to the patterns of Brhulk and undead. <hr>Seeing John’s retainers slain and the battlefield strewn with both human and bhrulk corpses unsettled me deeply. This was no ordinary skirmish—there was purpose in the carnage, as if something greater forced these enemies together only to tear them apart. The undead are relentless, the Brhulk are vicious, yet I cannot believe either alone was responsible for such a scene. No… there is something more sinister here, something stronger and more calculating than both. A power in the shadows, weaving death with intent. The thought clings to me like smoke, and I fear that in chasing John, we may come face to face with whatever malevolent force orchestrates this ruin.");'/>
                <input class="intro" type="button" value="Seigward" id="bSeig01" onclick='changeText01("By the grace of Austere, the Eternal Flame yet burns within me. I record these words not for pride, but for remembrance—that His light may be known in the deeds of those who carry it beyond the safety of stone walls.<hr>We have departed Eberard to seek the Baron of Greyll’s missing son, John. The path has already been tested by shadow and blood. Kaellen, the Oathless Blade, is a man of remarkable precision and restless spirit; I see strength in him that could serve the Light, if only he would kneel to it. Beans, though reckless and young, carries a spark of life that could one day become devotion. Shamshir, ever the observer, walks with quiet wisdom—he does not yet know it, but the Flame watches him too.<hr>When we crossed blades with the rival seekers upon the road, I saw no glory in their deaths—only necessity. I offered them the rites of passage and prayed Austere guide their souls to the light. The others buried them in silence, and for a moment, the dusk seemed to mourn with us.<hr>Later, when the undead struck at the gates of Greyll, I felt His power surge through me. Holy fire cascaded from my hands, and the lifeless were unmade. Beans and Kaellen fell, but the Light restored them. Such moments remind me that even in decay, there is purpose—Austere’s will burns brightest in places of ruin.<hr>We have now found the remains of John’s retainers, torn between Brhulk and bone. Yet the scene was not chaos—it was artifice. Something guided that slaughter, orchestrated it with intent. I cannot name it yet, but I feel its pull, deep as embers beneath ash. Perhaps this is why the Light called me here: to uncover not only corruption, but its source.<hr>The others see only a missing boy. I see the beginnings of revelation. If I am steadfast, Austere’s flame will consume the darkness—and what remains shall be shaped anew, purified in purpose.<hr>By His light, and for His glory.");'/>
                <input class="intro" type="button" value="Chronicle - Shamshir" id="bAChron01" onclick='changeText01("Our journey began in Eberard, the capital of Eberon. We assembled to investigate a troubling rumor: the Baron of Greyll is offering 1,500 gold for the return of his missing son, John, last seen six, now seven, days prior while ranging south with two retainers.<hr>The first to arrive was Kaelen, a 6-foot, 200-pound dark elf sell-sword known as the Oathless Blade. Beans, a small, 15-year-old, blond-haired, blue-eyed youth, and Seigward, a member of the Order of the Sacred Flame who reveres Austere, the god of light, soon joined. Recognition and camaraderie were established—Kaelen and Beans noted I hail from Al Setsier. Our party coalesced with clear motives: Kaelen sought camaraderie, Seigward to spread the light, Beans to enjoy a joke and a flagon of alcohol, and myself, to investigate and record events.<hr>We departed at 7:30 AM, traveling quietly through the roads and woods. The undead have besieged Eberard for weeks, advancing from the plains to the south and west. Along our journey, we remained vigilant, discussing the Order and our histories. Kaellen recounted his lineage as a half-elf trained in combat by his human mother and elf father.<hr>Our first encounter with other adventurers from the Herald’s office ended in battle. Kaelen, Seigward, and Beans executed a swift and deadly strike against the rival party, and we buried the fallen with Seigward’s prayer, honoring the dead. I reflected upon Nuara, the god of death, envisioning her scythe with its lantern.<hr>Travel continued with minor encounters, including a lute-playing young man whose music recounted the Battle of the Black Sky and whose possessions Beans attempted to acquire. We reached the outer walls of Greyll at night, amidst the sound of shuffling bones—the undead were not far behind. Skeletons clad in armor engaged us, wounding Beans and Kaelen, though Seigward’s healing and burning hands turned the tide. Entering Greyll, we sought rest at The Enchanted Mug, tended to our wounds, and gathered information from the locals about John and the creatures he fought—the bhrulk.<hr>The next day, we learned from Kel Thom Lagroth about John’s battles against bhrulk and undead. He warned of dangers southwest and advised us to proceed with caution. Our journey continued across a shallow river, investigation at every step. Kaelen mistook a dead horse for a brhulk, and we discovered the tragic remains of two humans, three brhulk, and one pile of bones—the humans presumed to be John’s retainers. Preparations began to give them a proper burial.");'/>

I cannot shake the feeling that the arrangement of corpses—humans, Brhulk, and undead—is no accident. A stronger, more sinister force is at work.<hr>The tracks led us to John Rivers, trapped beneath his panicked horse. Relief came at seeing him alive, yet the memory of his retainers’ deaths weighs heavily. He entrusted his mace, The Mighty Mace, to us as thanks, a reminder of the stakes we face.<hr>The Twaline that stalked us up the river was a chilling reminder that even in the open, predators watch and wait. Its intelligence and patience were unnerving, yet it eventually departed.<hrOur week in Greyll allowed some rest and planning. Beans received his daggers, while the rest of the party must wait two more weeks for their weapons. Kaellan, Seigward, and I remain mindful of the time ahead and the dangers that continue to grow.<hr>The Czardon attack reinforced my belief that this world’s monsters are cunning and deadly. They fed on fallen comrades to regain health, a brutal display of survival instinct. Beans acted quickly to stabilize Seigward when he was downed, a testament to the importance of cooperation.<hr>Tonight, we use the Czardon huts for shelter. Even in relative safety, I remain vigilant. The forces behind the undead and Brhulk are far more dangerous than we first imagined, and our path west will test us further.");'/>

It seemed right that the day’s final light should bless their rest. As we prayed, I felt Austere’s gaze linger—not in mourning, but in expectation. That night, His will was tested.<hr>A Brhulk came upon our camp, its stony hide deflecting steel and spell alike. Shamshir’s vigilance spared us death in our sleep, and Kaellen faced the beast with fearless resolve. My companions’ blades cut deep, but it was the flame of Austere that burned away its corruption. The creature’s cries became His hymn.<hr>At dawn we pressed on. I followed signs unseen by mortal eyes, guided only by the whisper of light in shadow. It led me to a sight both pitiful and divine: John Rivers, still breathing, pinned beneath his fallen steed. Whether this was mercy or judgment, I cannot say. We freed him, and Beans’ unorthodox methods mended his limb. Though crude, perhaps even that mischief has purpose in Austere’s plan.<hr>Our return to Greyll was met with reverence. The Baron wept; gold and gifts were bestowed. Yet while others rejoiced, I saw unrest behind the celebration. The armor upon the walking dead—the relics of the All War—is no accident. Souls bound to old banners do not rise of their own will. This reeks of necromancy, of a blasphemy that twists the sacred order of life and death.<hr>I have resolved to travel westward into the Plains of Basan and The Vastlands, to find the hand that commands the dead. My brothers of the Order would call it zeal. Perhaps they are right. But zeal, like flame, must be guided—or it consumes all.<hr>In battle against the Czardon, I felt that truth again. Their blood was thick with sin; their hunger, unholy. My radiance burned them where they stood, and for a moment, I felt the purity of purpose unclouded. Then darkness—pain—silence. Yet the Light did not leave me. It waits, patient and knowing.<hr>If Austere’s will is to purge this land of corruption, I shall obey.<hr>If His will is to reshape it, I shall ensure it is done correctly.<hr>By His name, and in the Flame’s truth—<hr>Seigward of the Eternal Order");'/>

The group—Seigward, Kaellen, Shamshir, and Beans—laid to rest the fallen retainers of John Rivers beneath the fading light of dusk. As the campfire flickered, a Brhulk crept into the clearing, its massive form nearly blending with the surrounding stone. Shamshir’s vigilance spared the party from ambush, and after a desperate fight—where Seigward’s invocation of Austere’s radiant flame finally felled the creature—the group endured the night under divine protection.<hr>By dawn, the search resumed. The trail led them southwest until it vanished, only to be rediscovered by Seigward’s keen faith-guided eye—a blood trail that revealed John Rivers himself, pinned beneath his dead horse. After rescuing him, the party learned he had survived for days after a skirmish with undead and Brhulk. Beans improvised a splint, and together, they escorted the wounded noble back to Greyll.<hr>En route, they crossed paths with a Twaline, a two-headed, spellcasting feline predator. Though the creature stalked them, it did not strike, vanishing into the plains like mist before lightning. By midafternoon, they reached Greyll’s gates. The guards ushered them inside, and before long, John was reunited with his family—Baron Riohvon Rivers and Lady Lyra. Moved by gratitude, the baron rewarded the party with 1,500 gold and John’s own weapon, a mighty mace forged at the King’s Spear. The heroes’ camaraderie solidified with humor and pride, their fellowship christened with an irreverent name: “The Great Cock.”<hr>As they rested, the Baron revealed troubling truths: the undead attackers bore the armor of soldiers who fell in the All War, fought eighty years ago in the Plains of Basan and The Vastlands to the west. Seigward resolved to seek the heart of the necromantic disturbance, vowing that Austere’s light would expose whatever corruption stirred the dead.<hr>Weeks passed in Greyll. Beans and Kaellen honed their craft, Shamshir meditated on Nuara’s silence, and Seigward prayed beneath the sigil of the Eternal Flame—ascending in power through divine grace. When work resumed, the party took a contract leading westward. Along the Green River, they discovered a Czardon fishing village—amphibious humanoids of Eridonian origin. Their parley with the creatures failed, and battle erupted.<hr>The Czardon fought fiercely, regenerating through cannibalistic rituals, but the adventurers stood fast. Seigward’s Radiance of Dawn seared through their ranks before he himself was struck down, his body broken but not extinguished. The others prevailed and tended to him as Austere’s light flickered dimly but did not die. They made camp in the creatures’ huts, the stench of blood and brine thick in the air, uncertain what horrors awaited them further west.");'/>

Kaellan and Beans followed horse tracks leading west, while Shamshir and Seigward completed the burials. Seigward identified the blood as human, and the party continued following it.<hr>They discovered John Rivers trapped beneath his fallen horse. The party freed him and stabilized his leg with a splint made by Beans. John explained that his retainers had been locked in battle and that his horse had panicked after the battle.<hr>While traveling northeast toward Fort Grey Hawk, the party encountered a two-headed apex predator, a Twaline. The creature followed them for two hours before departing. Upon reaching Greyll, the party returned John to his parents, the Baron and Lady Rivers, receiving the reward and John’s mace, The Mighty Mace, as a gift. The Baron provided information about the undead encountered: the armor was from the All War between humans and ash elves 80–100 years prior. Seigward sensed necromantic influence and emphasized the need to pursue it further west.<hr>During the week in Greyll, the party visited the smith The King’s Spear. Beans received his daggers, while Kaellan’s rapier, Seigward’s Aegis shield, and Shamshir’s duelist rapier will take another two weeks to finish. The party also paid respects to Kahl, the god of Justice.<hr>With Beans’ new daggers in hand, the party set out west to investigate potential necromantic activity. Traveling up the Green River, they encountered Czardon, amphibian- and reptilian-like creatures roughly 4–5 feet tall. A combat encounter ensued: Shamshir and Beans killed several Czardon with arrows, Seigward used Radiance of Dawn to damage multiple targets, and Kaellan delivered precise rapier strikes. The Czardon displayed predatory behavior, feeding on fallen comrades to regain health. Beans provided medical attention to Seigward after he was downed. The party ultimately defeated all Czardon and used their huts for shelter for the night.");'/>
