            <p class="rules">The czardon live in the Eridonian woods in nomadic tribes and are arggresive, attacking humans on sight. The czardon are rather intelligent and the most gifted of czardon can speak a rudimentary form of common, while all can signal thoughts though vocalizations and hand gestures. In the Age of Stories, a witch named Tabareth formed a pact with a tribe of czardon and taught them magic in exchange for their service. The czardon eventually killed Tabareth and consumed her and the teaching of simple magics would grow to become a custom in the czardon, usually equating to a few druids in large tribes. Czardon slightly alter depending on their spawning ground. Some hatch more lizard and salamander-like in deep woods. Czardon spawned by rivers, ponds, and lakes spawn into more fish, frog, alligator, or axolotl; in rare cases. Czardon spawn in 'litters' of nearly one hundred. Many of the czardon cannibalize each other while they are growing or when their tribemates die in combat.</p>
